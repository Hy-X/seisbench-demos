    "# Tutorial: Using the OKLAD (Oklahoma labeled AI dataset)) Dataset with SeisBench\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Hongyu Xiao @ OU\n",
    "\n",
    "**Last Updated:** 20251117\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the tutorial for the **OKLAD (Oklahoma labeled AI dataset)** dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a **curated collection of 1.14 million seismic waveforms and corresponding P/S-wave arrival times from the Oklahoma region**. It was specifically designed to **Benchmark deep learning models for induced seismicity phase picking** or **train models for induced earthquake discrimination**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, I will walk you through the essential steps to load, inspect, and utilize this dataset using the **SeisBench** framework. SeisBench provides a standardized toolkit for accessing and using seismological datasets, making it simple to integrate this data into your machine learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 2. What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Load** the `OKLAD (Oklahoma labeled AI dataset)` dataset using SeisBench's data loaders.\n",
    "* **Understand** the dataset's structure, metadata, and components (e.g., waveforms, labels, station information).\n",
    "* **Inspect** and **visualize** individual samples (waveforms and labels).\n",
    "* **Filter** and **preprocess** the data for a typical ML training pipeline.\n",
    "* **Integrate** the dataset with a SeisBench model (optional, but a good next step).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🖥️ 3. Prerequisites & Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Python, NumPy, and the core concepts of machine learning. Familiarity with [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki) is helpful but not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Software Requirements:**\n",
    "To run this notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `seisbench` (current code built on version 0.7.0)\n",
    "* `obspy`\n",
    "* `matplotlib` (for plotting)\n",
    "* `jupyter` (or `jupyterlab`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install them using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install seisbench obspy matplotlib jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "```"
